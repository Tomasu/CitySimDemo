Planning / Random Stuff
=======================



Figuring out how to:
    - represent streets/intersections...
    - represent "sims" (cars, people, bikes, whatever)
    - how sims/entities are "connected" to a given graph node/edge


We have options:
    - GOD graph that contains all data necessary to render
        - including nodes/edges that hold the sims that are on it...

    - simpler graph that just describes the road network that can be
      referenced by other data structures.
        - currently preferring this method. ^^^
